    "> **Note:** We can only obtain the `grad` properties for the leaf nodes of the computational graph, which have `requires_grad` property set to ``True``. For all other nodes in our graph, gradients will not be available. In addition, we can only perform gradient calculations using ``backward`` once on a given graph, for performance reasons. If we need to do several ``backward`` calls on the same graph, we need to pass ``retain_graph=True`` to the ``backward`` call.\n",
